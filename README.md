# XRPC

> [!WARNING]
> `xrpc` is an early development project.

## Introduction
A small (but very fun) project to explore RPC in C.
The goal is to explore and compare different implementations: from UNIX sockets to RDMA.

## Development
To get a working LSP, you can use [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) to generate a `compile_commands.json`.

```sh
bear -- make
```
